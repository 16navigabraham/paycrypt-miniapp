# 💰 PayCrypt Mini App

**Status:** 🚧 *In Active Development*

A mobile-friendly Web3 application that makes it easy to convert cryptocurrency into everyday services. Buy airtime, pay electricity bills, subscribe to TV channels, and purchase data — all with crypto, directly from your wallet.

- **⚡ Electricity Bills** - Pay power companies in Nigeria
- **📺 TV Subscriptions** - Subscribe to DSTV, Startimes, and other TV services

All from a single, user-friendly dashboard.
